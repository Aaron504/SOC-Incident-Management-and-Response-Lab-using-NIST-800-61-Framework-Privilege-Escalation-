In this lab, I managed and responded to security incidents within Azure Sentinel following the NIST 800-61 Incident Management Lifecycle. I started by analyzing detected alerts, setting severity levels, assigning owners, and investigating timelines and related events to determine whether incidents were legitimate (True Positive) or false alarms. For valid incidents, I applied containment, eradication, and recovery measures using automated playbooks. Finally, I documented my findings and closed the incidents in Sentinel. This lab demonstrates my ability to effectively manage and respond to security incidents in a structured SOC environment.
